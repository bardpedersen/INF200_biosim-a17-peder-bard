Welcome to group A17 BioSim's documentation!
============================================
BioSim is a school project developed to simulate the ecosystem on Rossum√∏ya.
The ecosystem is characterized by four different landscapes, lowland, highland, desert and water.
The island has only two different species, one species of herbivores (plant eaters), and one of carnivores (predators).
The full task can be found here: https://gitlab.com/nmbu.no/emner/inf200/h2021/inf200-course-materials/-/blob/main/january_block/lectures/INF200_H21_BioSimJan_Ja01.pdf
