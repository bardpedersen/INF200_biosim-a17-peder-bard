# BioSim A17 Peder Bård

# Description
January project for INF200 January 2022. This program is simulating the 
ecosystem on an island named Rossumøya. The island contains of two species,
herbivores that eats fodder and carnivores, that eat herbivores. 
The island has three types of land dessert, lowland and highland, and is 
surrounded by water. So the island is completely isolated. 
The full task can be found here:

This project simulates this by splitting the things happening to 
different functions and classes. Each file contains a different aspect 
of the island. Like animals contain the animal behavior as well as
all the prefixed parameters for them. All the classes and files are
nested or linked to the simulation file.
